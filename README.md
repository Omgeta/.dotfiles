# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my personal development environment. 

Yes, this is simple. Yes, this seems weird. But I like to use this environment since it gives me a clean customizable workflow on top of my existing Windows daily driver.

Details:
- WSL (Ubuntu)
- Windows Terminal
- zsh
- tmux
- nvim
- git

## Usage

(FUTURE) Run the `bootstrap.sh` script to automatically install all required dependencies onto your system.
```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

Run the `install.sh` script to automatically install all the necessary dotfiles onto the XDG directories.
```sh
./install.sh
```
